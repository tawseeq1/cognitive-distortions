In the sense that exams wise, imo econs is a much more manageable paper. If you're content/theory is good, you can definitely get an A no problem. History requires you to do 1 SBQ (very much different from sec sch history btw), and 2 essays. Of the 2 essays you have a lot of content to memorise for them. (Tldr: history has a lot more content coverage)\\n\\nAlso for background info, the stuff we learn in sec sch is kinda useless imo cuz 1. You learn a lot of new topics, 2. The previous knowledge is more for SBQ which doesnt require that much CK anyways.\\n\\nThat being said, you should consider your passion in both subjects. If you have a very strong passion for History, then it would be more beneficial to take h1 hist cuz you'll have more motivation/passion to study for it :D\\n\\nEdit: ALSO!! Econs its a lot easier to find help for cuz its a more commone subject. History help is usually found through ur teacher or googling the answers.\",\n",

It is how you apply them appropriately with context of the case studies in exams. \\n\\n>2. content\\n\\nMicroeconomics: Central Economic Problem, Demand-Supply analysis, Market failure. \\n\\nMacroeconomics: AD/AS analysis, Inflation, Unemployment, Macroeconomic Policies. \\n\\nThere will only be 2 case studies in a H1 econs paper. No essay components, unlike H2 econs and H1/H2 history. \\n\\n>3. will background knowledge help\\n\\nNot too sure about o level econs, but not taking econs at o levels should not stop you from getting an A for H1/H2 econs. Almost all students taking econs also didnt have any background knowledge anyway. If you take geog, it would help your econs csq marginally for description of trend qns (which is only around 1 or 2 marks so it isnt much anyway). \\n\\nFor hist: \\n\\n>2. content\\n\\ncold war in asia and UN (I think) \\n\\n>3. will background knowledge help\\n\\nMaybe, as the content for H1 history can be daunting and probably requires the cold war context.

But I feel that if there's anything worth noting its the Stockdale paradox.\\n\\nThat means accepting that you are lagging behind your peers. And that it will be a struggle to get to where you want to be (i.e. ideal uni course). That's reality.\\n\\nSo what does this mean? It means also trying to understand yourself as a student. If you are putting the same hours as others, are you studying less efficiently? If so, ask your peers and teachers for help. I think that if you had conversations with your hod, it means your teachers will always be looking out for you. Use that attention to ask for help. Your teachers really do care about seeing their students do well. They want to see you do well too.\\n\\nSecond, you also need to be optimistic. To me, A levels is always a gamble. People with U for prelims score A in A levels, people with straight As until prelims score B and C in As.\\n\\nWhy? Maybe because the former put in hard work. Maybe the latter was complacent. Maybe the questions are hard, or the answers were in greyer areas (esp in humans subjects).\\n\\nI have seen juniors struggling to get their lives together get their rp from 40 to 80+. Its definitely do-able.\\n\\nAs isnt just about how smart you are. Its about your personal discipline. Its about believing that you can do it.\\n\\nIts cliche as hell and I know, but knowing your odds and knowing that you can still beat them is your best bet.\\n\\nIts common to feel stressed during As. When you surround yourself with smart people, they will tend to outperform you at times. In the end, remember it is a competition with yourself. Its a bloody marathon not a sprint. Moreover,  them getting an A doesnt stop you from getting an A. \\n\\nSure, the Bell curve does exist.

              " 'Some tips to improve in terms of academics:\\n1. Pre-read and prepare in advance for your lectures. For lectures, read the lecture notes beforehand and do up some simple notes or you can stick post-it notes in the pages. I would suggest you use post-it notes for all your pre reading so you have space to note down important points brought up by the lecturer on the notes itself. By pre reading you can also take note of parts which you are unclear of/have questions. This way, when you go for lectures you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be so lost and can take better notes of the important points and also those parts you didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand in your prereading. Always take sometime after lecture or as soon as you have free time to consolidate what you learnt (try to do it asap so the information is still fresh and you can better retain the information).\\n\\n2. For tutorials, always go in prepared by doing all your preassigned homework. Tutorial usually happens after lectures on the particular topic so you can find chances to apply and practice the things you learnt from lectures (you can refer to the lecture notes while doing your homework, try not to refer so much after you grasp the whole concept so you can better structure the information stored in your brain)\\n\\n3. For math improvements, start to do your tys (topical) early. You can practice your math by topics that are currently being taught using your topical tys. Since you have a D for your H1 math, Iâ\\x80\\x99m assuming your foundations are pretty weak so start from the basics using your tutorial worksheets and tys. Nearer to the exams, schools will start giving out past year papers to students which are usually higher standards compared to tys so you can train your problem solving using the harder questions. \\n\\n4. For economics you can try to drill your explanations for all the concepts, make sure you can memorise by heart as econs explanations are rather fixed. Essay and case studies always require your depth and breath analysis so you have to really understand the lecture notes fully and be able to apply them. As you advance further into jc, you will need to start identifying question types and their requirements. (Thereâ\\x80\\x99s always fix formats that your school will teach you, or you can try to identify them yourself and prepare your own notes for them)\\n\\nI didnâ\\x80\\x99t take history and literature so I canâ\\x80\\x99t really help much but im assuming history is very content heavy so you might require alot of drilling like econs as well? \\n\\nAs for your social situation, if you feel that your friend is drifting away from you do you know the reason why? Try to identify the reason and patch your relationship, or you can make friends with other classmates or even people from other classes. If you have a CCA it can also help, maybe make friends from your CCA through trainings. In my opinion, friendship should come naturally if you find the correct people that you can click with, no point in trying so hard to make friends or it wonâ\\x80\\x99t be long lasting and it will tire you out mentally as well. You can still make friends even if you are socially awkward, you still have 1+ years with your classmates so try to be friendly when others approach you, some people are more prone to approaching people whole others are more prone to being approached so ditch all your opinions on others and try to understand them better to get closer. For your pw groupmate try to put down the dislike against the other person and focus on your pw instead so you wont have to think about these social issues but use pw as a connection point in your communications. I know it is hard but never stop trying, relationships with people requires good communication and also chemistry so donâ\\x80\\x99t be too upset if you cannot find someone who can truly understand you. Afterall it is your life to live and these people might be temporary in your life, you might not even meet them after jc, so just be yourself. \\n\\nAll the best for your jc life, hope these tips helps! :)',\n",
              " 'I shall copypaste part of a comment I made on another post:  \\n\\n\"To allay your fears, the majority of students including those who score very well in the end, do badly at some points in their JC life. We all have to admit that nothing has prepared us for this kind of rigour and we will take time to adapt\".\\n\\nTake me for an instance. I calculated both my rank points for my J1 MYE and yours. I assumed an A for PW in both calculations and I scored 63.75 while you scored 65. However, I went on to get 90 for my actual A levels. So well, are you really screwed? My answer is I think it\\'s really too early to say. \\n\\nThis is your 1st exam in JC and it\\'s perfectly normal that you can\\'t grasp many of the concepts and techniques to score well yet. There are many more to come so don\\'t beat yourself down just because of 1 exam. The real problem only sets in if you wallow in self-doubt and become too emotionally affected by your grades. \\n\\nIf JC has taught me 1 thing, it is to be resilient and always be ready to bounce back from failure. Seek help from your teachers after this. Ask them to go through with you your mistakes in the exam and let them offer their input especially when you\\'re an arts stream student. Keep a list of tips that your teachers give and actively remind yourself in the future when you\\'re writing essays. Also, I can assure you that you\\'re doing a good job for Econs because a lot of people are struggling to pass at this stage and you\\'ve got a B. Keep up the good work! \\n\\nRegarding your social life, it\\'s unfortunate that you landed in the same group as the person you dislike. However, life often throws unexpected and unpleasant stuff at you so you just got to bear with it. Learn to converse professionally with that person in the capacity of a group member if you cannot treat her as a friend. Try as hard as you can to temporarily put down your grievances when work is concerned so as to not affect the group morale. Think of the big picture. Besides that, learning to deal with this sort of inter-personal relationship is really good practice for working life in the future. \\n\\nAlso, it\\'s alright not to have a large group of friends. I believe it\\'s better to have 1 or 2 really close friends than dozens of friends that barely know you. If you feel comfortable, you can try to ask if you can join some classmates for recess/lunch. If having a conversation is not a natural thing for you, think of topics to say before you start talking. For example, you could ask about someone\\'s weekend, find out about someone\\'s family (if they have a sibling or not), any show recommendations, etc. There are millions of ways to start the conversation and if you find yourself with nothing to say, ask questions to keep it moving. Chances are the other party will ask you some questions back too. Try to avoid gossip and talking behind people\\'s back even though you have a \"target\" in mind. It reflects poorly on your character. Let people be the judge for themselves.',\n",
              " \"Don't worry too much about your results in J1 MYE, bcos most ppl mess up their J1 MYE anyways. But you should definitely see what factors may have affected your marks (the social stress may be a factor too, its not just influenced by studying), and try to seek solutions for those problems.\\n\\nOn the social aspect: Don't mind those people who abandon you, instead keep your good friendship with your friend and explain to him/her your situation as well. And if possible, maybe find other muggers (maybe its easier to make friends with them or at least get some company when studying). And for J1 atleast, you can still be a bit loosened up and try to enjoy your CCA or other activities a bit more. If all else fails, you can chat with some of us in Reddit every now and then to add some flavour into your day. Honestly I'm not very good at this either lol, so I think the other comments serve you better here.\\n\\nOn how to improve your grades: Well, at this stage you should take some time to identify where you went wrong, and work on fixing that part of your exam/essay. For History, its likely due to your first time doing JC History (but you're doing pretty good for the first time) and you will get better if you keep practicing it and listening to your teacher's advice. For Math, I recommend going through the paper and seeing which topics you made more mistakes in/what kind of careless mistakes you make. Then try to do similar questions and actively try not to make those mistakes (if its a conceptual problem, revisit your concepts and ensure you understand them before starting the questions). For GP, the ways one can mess up are pretty varied and consulting your teacher may help. But if you can identify the problem from the comments, then I suggest checking out my Youtube GP Strategy Series (in AlkalineHydroxide784), hopefully it helps. \\n\\nFeel free to pm me anytime :)\",\n",

Clunky introduction. It is usually more practical to start with a short introduction because under timed conditions, you\\'ll want to get to your content paragraphs. Writing your evaluation at the start before you start your content paragraph is a bit silly, since the examiner needs to read your content to give your base level marks and then read back. Most likely, you\\'ll end up repeating the same arguments in your evaluative argument in the end. Moreover, since the Asian Tigers content portion is the easiest to learn (i.e. not a lot of room to test), it is difficult to stand out among the rest. What my teacher recommended, and I concur, is to really begin your essay with a quote. A strong hook to differentiate yourself. This mainly applies if you\\'re already in the A band. \\n2. I think your thesis statement was not clear enough. I think you can do better to qualify what you mean by \"its own efforts\", and the actors involved. Get straight to the point instead of worrying too much about evaluation.  Since your thesis statement is unclear, I am not very sure about the overall direction / central thrust of your essay.  Your factors are about 1. the government 2. the chaebol 3. SK culture. \\n3. If you really wanted to create strong nuance in your thesis statement, you should argue - \"between the state, the chaebol, and the South Korean culture\", which of them played the biggest role? This is the huge missed opportunity as you could have QUALIFIED what you meant by \"its own efforts\", instead of generally re-affirming the statement once again. \\n4. Your first argument for the chaebol is okay, but not the strongest evidence was provided. Your argument should have been about HOW the chaebol was an engine for economic growth. Merely arguing that they were dominant is only proving that they were successful, but insufficient in showing the mechanism. This goes from analyzing the ingenuity of chaebols in chasing after the Middle Eastern construction boom in the 1980s, or at least explain further how their unique organizational structure improved this \"efficiency\" that you never really proved. The overall problem is that the story you tell is incomplete. You can start from the tale of a single firm like Lucky Goldstar, Samsung or Hyundai and explain their genius before relating it to the broader economy. \\n5. Second point on Confucian culture is generally correct, but  you can relate it to the hardship that the Koreans were willing to endure. You can do this by relating it to the eventual June uprising and their resistance against authoritarian rule, to show how the populace was accepting of the restriction of civil liberties to create stability - a pre-requisite for economic growth following the tumultuous period of the Korean War. \\n6. Your counter argument on US aid amidst the Cold War can be better developed and nuanced.  The thing is that even between a major power and a presumed \"puppet\" state, the \"puppet\" state has agency in ensuring that the help given by the larger power is directed strategically. Examples include:  C. President Park\\'s decision to actively involve itself in the Vietnam War when it is not part of SEATO to obtain additional aid from US. What you could have shown is the intricate relationship between South Korea and USA and that it is not as simple as initially perceived. \\n7. Be explicit in your point. Qualify WHO you are talking about in \"its own efforts\" when you mention \"directed government policies\". The problem I sense from your writing is that your examples sometimes serve as weak substitutes for actual explanation. \\n8. So your implicit argument is that the state played the biggest role? Could have been argued for, but once again you retreated to repeating the question. I wouldn\\'t call it \"empire building\" but the process is called \"selecting champions\".\\n9. The biggest weakness in your essay is the failure to recognize the symbiotic relationship between the chaebol and the state and to fully develop it in your argument. \\n10. Following the previous point, you need to argue more effectively BETWEEN your factors. If not, the evaluation marks will be quite weak and you probably cannot crack beyond 22.\\n11. South Korea Incorporated or a Miracle by the Han River? These are terminologies of which the nuance you should fully unpack.\\n12. One more big content problem in your essay: you talking about US aid. Theoretically, most of the US aid ended by the 1960s. Hence, it is before the time frame of the 1970s established by the essay and the syllabus. There is a risk that your points can be tangential to what is expected. You should have related it to broader macro-economic events in the 70s. These include things like the oil shocks, and even an analysis on the Asian Financial Crisis.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOnce again, I am sorry for being rather critical of your essay but nonetheless it was a decent piece of work.

Applying your points (aside from the \"hook\"; that\\'s something I find entirely unnecessary) would certainly produce an A grade. \\n\\nHowever, it may seem too overwhelming, especially for students that 1.

It is really helpful to stand out right from the start. Maybe that's just his personal preference, but using quotes generates flow and gives your essay more credibility. \\n\\nSpecifically to your writing, I really liked your flowery language. However, sometimes your flowery language really muddled the logic and flow of the paragraph. For me, my literature skills are horrendous but I rely a lot on effective writing. Just get the point across, and move on. \\n\\nTrue, the rote method and the need for a shell is something that is so hard to break out of. To some extent, you can always prepare better essay structures but what is crucial is to really understand the content beyond a level of just memorizing the examples. Cambridge will always try to invent new essay questions to throw you off. For this specific topic, the essay question I feared the most was to compare between South Korea and Taiwan. Structurally, it is very complex to write. They do this precisely because they know many students are so reliant on the shell, that any deviations can effectively sort out who really understands the content. \\n\\nTime management is a huge issue that boils down to your handwriting speed and how well you know the content. What is important therefore is to know how to write SUCCINTLY. It really helps to plan before every essay (recommend 3 -5 minutes) then go all out and chiong.\",\n",

If you're lucky or use enough essay structures, you'll probably hit a strong B on average and crack into the low A band if lucky. \\n\\n\\\\- important thing in history / any other subject is to be CONSISTENT. So die die must allocate time fairly between the different essays and SBQ. If you put too much time in one essay, legit gg. Although I have seen my friend get 18 / 30 for a one page essay, please don't try to replicate this insanity. This boils down to discipline. If you know you're a strong B student, always try to target the same quality across your essays and chances are you can edge up to A band (if Bell curve wills so).\\n\\nTo those who are legit barely staying afloat / feel like they are drowning: \\n\\n\\\\- if you're really struggling, just focus on your notes first and give them a read.\\n\\n\\\\- focus on essay PLANS. First thing is to ALWAYS PRACTICE YOUR THESIS STATEMENT. IMPORTANT!! No need to be fancy with it. A simple sentence gets the job done. For each paragraph, focus on writing the TOPIC SENTENCE and give 2 -3 PIECES OF EVIDENCE per paragraph. Why? Because by forcing yourself to do so you 1. save time by ensuring your content points are covered roughly equally so it improves ur time management 2. it FORCES you to select the BEST examples ( in exams you legit don't remember everything one ... so just remember the BEST examples / ones you like) \\n\\n\\\\- from there, you can slowly try to work on the evaluation. These basic evaluation points are usually fed (depending on your teacher and quality of your notes). Getting the basic evaluation points down WELL ENOUGH is usually sufficient to give you a good shot at the lower A band. \\n\\nProblem with tuition / notes:\\n\\n\\\\- Honestly, sometimes even your teachers and tutors can get it horribly wrong. I remember in my year, since it was the first time the new syllabus came out, one history JC department MISREAD the syllabus. So how? That cohort had a 20 % distinction rate for History. Unlikely to happen again, since the syllabus has probably settled and that poor history teacher probably got sent elsewhere. \\n\\nThis is where my advice always come in. Don't be afraid to challenge your tutors. They may not get it right all the time, especially in the social sciences. Trust me. If leading economists can screw up so massively, what makes you think your teacher is infallible? Just ask them respectfully. If they can't give you a decent answer, that's where I suggest turning elsewhere for help. \\n\\n\\\\- I'm not sure about the JC history tuition scene, but it is definitely not as prolific as the sciences. To take history, you are probably a brave soul who either loves the Humanities or one who thinks that history was easier than Bio (tough luck but hey you may be right).

I went to the info session thinking that it\\'ll convince me, but I left it with more doubts than certainties. \\n\\nComputing and Law sounds like the best of both worlds, as being a tech savvy lawyer, which admittedly sounds good as a career but as a degree and a field of study, it seems very questionable. \\n\\nYou won\\'t get to take the bar and be an official lawyer, and when it comes to taking on a more technical role, it\\'s possible, but compared to the increasing CS and IS cohorts, your degree and expertise will fall short. Law and computing is interesting but its too niche of a field, and I know friends doing Law that as venturing in Tech Law and possibly into the supposed roles this degree is trying to field its UGs to. And as an employer I would rather a practicing lawyer for the role than someone without a solid field of study in law. \\n\\nAnd coupled with the fact that its a new course, it\\'s still questionable whether there will be a job market for such C&L degree holders in the future.\\n\\nDegree programmes aren\\'t meant to be very specialised or specific for a reason, and computing and law, considering it is 1 degree ( you\\'re getting a Bachelor of Science in C&L) and not a double degree in both, is too niche to be a direct field of study. It feels more like a specialisation for law students. And coupled with the fact that it\\'s dipping toes into two job markets, one already very saturated and the other increasingly saturated, doesn\\'t sound very ideal to me.\\n\\nBut if it seems very interesting and ideal for you, then go ahead! Who knows, maybe this degree will be the next CS? But please don\\'t do it because you\\'re star-struck by the words \"Computing\" and \"Law\".\\n\\nNo qualms about NTU CS, just that since its part of NTU\\'s engineering school, there are physics mods u have to take under CS.

              " '>some negative inc the student culture being very bad(?)\\n\\nhmmmmmm I think it depends on who you interact with. If by \"bad\" meaning unmotivated students, as far as I know, the SAS students are generally quite motivated and friendly. Depends on what you mean or what you have read about that mentioned the student culture as \"bad\". \\n\\n>lecturers giving little to no resources/ help\\n\\nIt depends on who you get as your lecturer. As far as I know the RP SAS full-time lecturers do provide help when you need, you just need to ask them nicely. As for some part-time lecturers, maybe some aren\\'t that helpful, some are helpful. From my previous experiences with both full-time and part-time lecturers, I only had one lecturer who wasn\\'t very helpful and he was not from SAS. \\n\\n>some journal thing every morning that takes a lot of time??\\n\\nI believe \"journal\" refers to Reflection Journal (RJ)? RJ is done after class and submitted before 2359 most of the time (if not some lecturers may give up till 0800 the next day). From my experience, RJ questions that require more time are academic/science questions, while those that are more \"reflective\" like \"What you think you could have done better\" kind doesn\\'t require much time. Overall, you don\\'t have to spend more than 3h doing RJ, just put enough quality content (don\\'t write irrelevant content of course) and you should be fine.',\n",

              " 'Unmotivated and \"idgaf\" students exist not only in RP, but probably in every other school, even in uni like mine (NUS, since it is one of the top unis in SG). I had experienced unmotivated students in my uni too, so it isn\\'t an RP exclusive thing. \\n\\nUsually, one module would have 13 daily grades, assuming 13 weeks of lessons and every lesson is graded. There are some exceptions where certain modules have fewer daily grades because there is an individual mini CA paper to submit, but there isn\\'t many modules in SAS (esp Biomed) that have those modules. Anyways, RJ are mostly graded towards your daily grade which eventually contributes to your overall module grade. I know of some lecturers that mainly rely on the written quiz given at the end of the lesson to determine your daily grade, or some may use presentation as one of the deciding factors if one deserves an \"A\" or not. I can\\'t generalise the entire SAS lecturer population\\'s grading style since each lecturer looks out for different things when they grade students. Ultimately, from me and my friends experience, midterm and finals (we call it MSA and ESEs) have a higher weightage than daily grades. So let\\'s say if you score A (>80%) for both MSA and ESEs even though you may have gotten all Bs for daily grade, your overall grade for the module is still an A (which is a 4.0).',\n",

              " 'Hi!i am a student from ejc.Personally,i would say that ejc students are often unfairly stereotyped as egoistic by many people.Every jcs has its fair share of egoistic students,even in ejc,it is not an exception.However,i would say that the situation at ejc is being blown out of proportion.There are two examples that i would like to state in order to prove that most ejc students are not egoistic.The first example is during my first day of ORI, i was put in a sub group of ORI with 3 IP students.Initially,i thought that my ejc ORI would be like my secondary school ORI where everybody would just not interact with eachbother.To my surpirise, my sub group mates make the effort to make me feel welcomed into the eunoia family.We talk about our own school life and persoanl life.From those interactions,i realise that the jae-ip segraegation issue has been blown completely out of proportion:we have more similarities than differences.The second example is my interaction with my classmates in my \\nCG.Even though my CG has many top scorers or people talanted in sport and music,we interact with each other as if we were friends,i could not sense any form of arrogance from my classmates,instead what i sense is that most of them are very humble and willing to take the initiative to know more about their classmates.Of course,this may be my own personal examples but my experiences are also very similar to some of my secondary schoolmates who come to ejc and say that their classmates and teachers make them feel that ejc is their second home.\\n\\nAs for the school culture,i would say that in ejc we are quite bonded.We have many house events like inter-house games and i think that those events unite all of us together and give us a sense of belonging to ejc.\\n\\nAll in all,i was once in your shoe who have to make the tough decision to go to which jc.At that time,i did not realise it but i found out after going into ejc is that diversity is also quite an improtant factor.When the school is doverse enough,you will have the opoortunity to know more about the lives of people from all walk of life.In ejc,there is a fair mix of dsa,jae and jip students.Those diversity helps us to know more aboit each other and in terms change our own perspectives on many matters.Personally,I think that i may not have gained those new perspectives and thus develop as a mature student  if i have not chosen ejc.',\n",

Those of my friends who studied accounting and work a few years in accounting, already exit the industry for better work-life balance.

But the focus actually should be on you, not the average student. The thing is whether which degree gives u better prospects actually depends on your own interest level and your own aptitude in gauging the chances of u excelling in the degree course or not. You should be focusing on which degree can bring the best out of you, realising your potential by capitalising on your strengths and interest. What's suitable for others, may not be suitable for u. Even if a degree has how super good a prospect, if your aptitude is not there and you are not cut out for it, force-fitting yourself into what's trending out there will just make u likely end up as a below-average graduate of the trendy degree, and end up getting lower than average salary, and be a mediocre office worker. Instead, find a degree that fits your interest and strengths the best, so that u can aim to be the best in your chosen field.\",\n",
